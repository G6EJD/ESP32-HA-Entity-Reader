# ESP32-HA-Entity-Reader
This programme will read Entity values from Home Assistant via it's API access method.

You need to locate both files in the same directory, then edit the credentials.h file to contain your WiFi SSID, WiFiPASSWORD and then obtain an Home Assistant API key.

Get an Home Assistant API Key from:

User (bottom left of main screen)
Select on the top-line SECURITY tab
Scroll down to 'Long-lived access tokens'

Create the key and make a copy somewhere, it can't be retrieved after being created!

It's a long key so use care in copying and storing it.
